# Customer Churn Prediction | Machine Learning (Python)

## Overview
Built a machine learning model to predict customers likely to churn and provide insights for retention strategy.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared data
- Performed EDA using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- Built ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Tuned hyperparameters
- Evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, ROC-AUC
- Explained model results with SHAP values

## Impact
- Achieved 89% accuracy and AUC of 0.92
- Identified top churn drivers (contract type, charges, tenure)
